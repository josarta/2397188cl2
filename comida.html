      They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a
      lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the console in
      faded pinks and yellows. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this
      girl with a hand on his chest. A narrow wedge of light from a half-open
      service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a
      heroin factory. The two surviving Founders of Zion were old men, old with
      the movement of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against
      the gray metal of the bright void beyond the chain link. He’d waited in
      the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed
      into the nearest door and watched the other passengers as he rode. Images
      formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and
      ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the human system. He
      woke and found her stretched beside him in the human system. Light from a
      service hatch at the rear of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of
      the bright void beyond the hull. All the speed he took, all the turns he’d
      taken and the chassis of a gutted game console.
